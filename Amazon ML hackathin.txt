We have approached this ml hackathon by using linear svm algorithm, where we have used NLP and extracted new feauters from the dataset 
and used it to predict the Length of the product.
we have basically used tfidfVectoriser to make a new feature, and get the numeric of all the important data. then by using this we are using Linear SVM
and predict the length of the product.
